Is it enough to carry over monthly?1) I want to make a wild book about the future and about money in the future.I call it velocity capitalism. Might your platform be able to do this for me or do I need help from chat GPT before plugging the prompts into your platform?2) if I run out of words or chapters, can my next months credits be used with the prior history understood and continued, or do I need to start from fresh all over again? Or can I paste all those thousands of pages into the landing prompts, or is any of this impossible to do the following month if I run out of credits?3) Can I break up the book and credits by the calendar month and if not then what suggestions do you have? Upgrade to tier 3? Hopefully Tier 2 can do it, right?Founder TeamIoannis_YoubooksOct 14, 2025A: Here is what you can do on Tier 2Use the first month credits to create sources. Make sure you add ALL the content you want for a specific project into a single source. Book projects cannot use multipel sources yet. You can ingest up to 500K words into sources with the first month's credits.Make a few human models too, at 200K words each, they are 20K credits, cheap.On the second month, you can churn out 4 books at 100K characters each + 20% human model. You can keep doing that every month. This is just an example use, obviously.1) Yes, it can do it, but do not just enter a title. Chat with chatgpt regarding your project, ask it to ask you questions, and then to draft you an outline. Paste that in the youbooks description input.3)  No, credits do not roll over. But even a 300K word book (monster with little commercial value) is less than 300K credits, which is below the 500K you have each month.Tier 3 and 4 are only if you want BYOK, which is mostly useful for high volume users (publishers, marketters, etc.). I don't think you need this. If you want more credits, you can get 2 or more Tier 2 and ask us to combine them, but, try with one first to see if this works for you. It sounds like you have a specific vision in your head, and Younooks dos not have amny control features; it's great if you want to one-shot an entire book and are flexible. you can/should always edit the output to shape it as you want.Comment(1)ShareShare youbooksHelpful?1Log in to join the conversationLog inAjeetSo I can combine my Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts into one account with higher credits?How about Source materials created, can they be merged into one account too?WaSumoWaSumoPLUSNov 2, 2025See detailQ:To use a human model or not on the book? Benefit vs Quality output?Hi.I believe you mentioned using a “humanizing model” within YouBooks will degrade the final output?

Now, I’m planning to upgrade to the higher tiers!I created my first ebook with only 20k+ words. I didn’t expect much since it was only a test, but I’m already impressed with the results. I didn’t even use the advanced models or the custom human voice and writing styles.I'm in a coffee shop right now, skimming the generated content, and I have to say I would never have guessed an AI wrote this. It sounds authentic and comes across as if the author is an expert in the field.Again, I didn’t use a custom human voice, only the default one. However, I included as much detail as possible in my prompt and enabled the ""internet search"" option. These may have helped improve the output.I haven’t tried the human models and style prompts yet but look forward to testing them. I’m sure these features will make the output even more impressive.So now, I am officially using the generated output as my ""first draft."" Thanks to YouBooks, I saved hours or even days!The platform is simple to navigate and understand. I love that the credits and other details are clearly visible prior to the generation - avoiding confusion and misunderstandings on credit consumption.I'm also glad that there is a PWA version of the platform. This makes it faster and easier to access YouBooks on my phone, tablet, or laptop while on the go.The founder and his team are awesome! They genuinely listen to users and respond quickly to queries. This shows their dedication to the project, which is a huge plus for me.Youbooks generates content using multiple AI models that enhance cohesion across different chapters. In my understanding, the AI models will vet and ""talk"" with each other to come up with a better and more cohesive output. This has been the selling point for me. I used a different AI writing platform in the past where the writing was okay, but the chapters were not very consistent and coherent.If you are serious about creating and publishing non-fiction books that readers will love to read, then youbooks is a top choice. Just understand that quality output takes time. And it goes without saying that some vetting, scrutiny, and refinement may still be needed to complete or finalize your book. But the important thing is, you're already done with the first draft - which is usually the hardest part.Read lessFounder TeamIoannis_YoubooksOct 31, 2025Thank you! I was thinking of your review and the negative review below, and it kind of occured to me that positive reviews and negative reviews (the non-spammy ones) say the same thing - youbooks produces a first draft that you can then edit to taste. What differs then, between the 5 taco reviews and the 2 taco ones, is more or less the expectations of the customer.We stand behind our claim that youbooks is the best (and slowest) AI book generator for one-shoting long-form non-fiction books. There is no magic to it. If you sat in front of Gemini and prompted it 1000 times with the right prompts and inputs, you would get a better result than a 20 prompt sequence that generates one chapter after the other. That's what youbooks does.This does not, under any circumstances, imply that youbooks can generate a final draft that matches your taste, and the highest non-fiction writing standards. To get there, you will need to edit. Youbooks does not provide an editing module at this point although we are considering adding one in the future to ""complete"" the product.Helpful?6ShareShare youbooksSee detailVukPLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 189Member since: Mar 2015Oct 31, 2025I really wanted to like thisI tried a free ebook. The result was bad. Then I bought tier-2.I uploaded articles I've written over the years to create my own model. It took a long time.Then I carefully crafted a Table of Contents and a prompt using Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT with back and forth improvements. My prompt was rated as 95% good. 24 hours or so later, I received an awful lot of unusable stuff. To be able to publish that would require a lot of work and the result would still be bad.I have several prompts that I use with AI engines, that can create a full 2500 words chapter that barely needs editing. This means that I can produce a good quality 50K words book in less than 5 days, ready to publish. In contrast, editing the book from youbooks would take me more than 5 days and the result would be far from good.But I tried again with another book. This time I spent less time on the prompt, copy-pasting almost straight from Claude. The result was underwhelming, if slightly better. Style problems, poor narration, poor structure - it was an eyesore.So I tried another one. This time I opted for ""expensive models"" since the not expensive ones are so bad. In his answers to the questions, the product's owner recommends avoiding this expensive 4x model altogether. The result was much better than the two previous tries. This time I got something that still needs heavy editing, but probably not more than 2 days of work. Is it good ? Not really, but it's not bad either.What is the future for this tool ? I'm not sure. I need to give it another couple tries but credits renew only on the 26th and I bought the product on the 27th so I'm gonna have to wait a full month before I can do additional checks. For now I will give it two tacos and I'll change my rating if I get better results.You should buy it only if you are prepared to edit heavily. As a former journalist, editor-in-chief and owner of a content agency, I know how to edit long form documents.Or if you are not interested in editing, just in publishing mounds of copy.The question is : would I get a better book if I use my own prompts with Gemini or Claude ? If that's the case then I have no use for Youbooks.  Create a prompt with a TOC. Upload it to Gemini with instructions to write one chapter after the other while keeping the whole thing coherent.  It's not rocket science and you get to check each chapter after it's created, which gives you ample time to correct things for the following chapters. Well, I'll perform additional checks in a month...Read lessFounder TeamIoannis_YoubooksEdited Oct 31, 2025Perhaps the best bad review we have received :)You are right that Youbooks will not produce edit-ready copy. ChatGpt does not produce edit ready articles. One-shotting a book is a 100x harder task. This is not an excuse. It's a property of the product that many positive reviews have also pointed out. If you care about quality and tailoring to your taste, you need to edit as you correctly pointed out.However, you are not right to suggest that prompting Gemini to produce the next chapter and the next will produce a similar book. I am sure you are saying this in good faith. And I am sure you think it could work. And the matter of the fact is that there is a bunch of AI book maker apps that are doing just that.Youbooks does not. I have been through enough evals (hundreds by now  over a period of a year) to make me want to cry false at your statement. I understand  you think this is the case and you have the best intentions. But you come from a place of well-intended assumptions vs a lot of trial and experience. Try this. Take a topic that is niche enough to have a chance of selling (not another book on how to make passive income). Write a book using your technique with Gemini. Do the same with youbooks (don't use human models, leave internet search ON). Produce 80K words of text that is an average nonfiction book. Ask a strong model like ChatGpt Pro to rate the youbooks output and the Gemini stitched output.I appreciate your honest opinion. If it was only a matter of taste, I would be happy to also agree with the last point (what's gold for some is poop for others). It's only because we can run AI based evals to get some sense of an un-biased feedback, that I find the courage to push back.Helpful?0ShareShare youbooksSee detailThokaPLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 102Member since: May 2020Oct 29, 2025It's not working that well at the momentTried it 2 times to get a book (used another account to test it, but subscribed after that with AppSumo anyway as I guess you guys will handle this within the future). Somehow the chapters and titles within the book are messed up. Probbaly it's better not to serve a Table of Terms. The chapter numbering within the whole book is pretty confusing. Sometimes chapters are made double.The Translation costs are pretty immensive: ""Top-up at least 195.993 credits to translate"" It' Even much more as to get a new book. I thin I spent 80K Credits to create the book.Overall my test: It's not bad and a lot of potentialin it, but at the momen it could not deliver what it promissed.

They are not included in the Appsumo plans or the subscription plans.To make it clear, youbooks supports generating new books in non-english languages. Translating a book is a different service though.Helpful?1ShareShare youbooksSee detailphpviewPLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 98Member since: Jun 2025Oct 29, 2025The leader of long-form content writingI did some other ""AI"" writer more than 5 years ago and I had to grade it a C- to a D-, almost unusable. Things have changed a lot since then. This isn't a 1st generation product and it's nice to give feedback to and get responses from Ioannis, the purveyor. We had a back and forth over some of the pain points where editing is the largest painpoint of this product if you want it published. A bunch of things have been fixed and there is an analyzer of the prompt which grades it to 100. The 6000 character prompt limit is a problem if your book outline/toc is 9-12+ chapters. Human model does well for words over a certain amount. There should be another section with its own limit for the toc/outline because of the 6000 character limit. https://www.youbooks.com/roadmap shows citation concerns that are being worked on. For example, ""RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) hallucinations are instances where a large language model (LLM) generates incorrect or fabricated information even when using retrieved documents for context."" Giving this feedback helps them to consider Chicago footnote style citations/references and bibliography page automation instead of us simply getting an export of URLs for us to edit which is on the roadmap. The TOS of websites like Reddit does not allow for scraping for training. But, you can use sources like sourcely.net (site is down as of this writing but I've subscribed before). They have a future vision for Advanced Publishing, among 3 others, but they can simply offer an API key for developers. If not, allowing for a 3rd party addon marketplace for post-production editing is also good but more complex under contractual agreement. They fixed the header problem which makes it easier for you to edit portions of your deliverable. If things are modularlized, then that opens up the possibility of them adding features after your book is delivered such as adding chapters. If you ask for doctorate level content, other AI models find it as high quality. I've had it make more than 50+ books. The exact number is known by OCR into Google Sheets and categorized for genre and subgenre. It's going to take you some time to nail down your own process. It's capable of making fiction (I have not tried) because the prompt box takes in a toc/outline. But you have to know what to parameterize. ""Use Freytag's Pyramid framework (for the plot), temperature (randomness) average, base it on the real life story of..., use this outline/toc, use a narrative structure with dialogue, etc."" I've had it write me a language learning book and it's in the A range as a product. It does disregard your toc suggestions to a certain extent but now, you can review and modify it. Ethics-wise, it is biased mainly in your favor and the RAG guardrails of the AI model. But, all AI models are sophisticated mimicry which precludes them from true creativity, productivity, value creation, and human connection. Human review is required based on the subject matter as it can side with misinformed consensus instead. An example of this is for me as a creationist is macro-evolution. The AI models used does do RAG in varying degrees but the conclusions are invalid since it can disregard quantified data and pick false qualitative and published data. LLMs are part statistical guesswork on the contents of the sentence and the next sentence in a paragraph. It does logic checks more with the outline and its consulting the Named Entity Recognition (NER) database for things like country names. For example, most mutations are harmful and thus evolution cannot overcome the beneficial frequency required with the low number of beneficial mutations for it to be true. Protein folding can't be explained either by evolution, etc. with 3d search by randomness taking 10^33 years to find the correct one. So, it mimics reasoning but it can still hallucinate (fabricate sentences) even with RAG since it can’t do human logic based on its academic processing framework. You can tell it to stick with quantitative logic but they don’t know what to quantify then. However, this platform also has huge potential and fiction is more lucrative but the manual post-production editing is very time consuming depending on your topic. It is only as good as your understanding of prompt engineering, and that took me several months through trial and error. I wish Ioannis/Youbook much success. Great product if your goal is to have lifetime ghost writing assistance. (Fixed grammar errors). Totally worth the highest tiers you can get depending on your business case.Read lessFounder TeamIoannis_YoubooksOct 29, 2025Thank you!

Your LTD is a brick in the foundations that youbooks is built on, so wherever this goes, it is thanks to you.We wouldn’t mind a review either! That’d be more of a pillar than a brick! ;-) drop your pillar herehttps://appsumo.com/products/youbooks/reviews/new/It was not without drama. Youbooks seems to be dividing Sumo-lings between yb-lovers and yb-haters. It’s either 5 tacos or 1-taco and that’s it.A true battlefield! Choose a side and do what you must do :-OWe’ve rolled out (as per user requests)…TOC editing and approval (in Beta)Project deletionNot changing the title when explicitly specifiedSmall bug fixes on the client and workflows…and that’s only in 2 short weeks, full of support requests and general crazy-ness.Our GPUs have been burning hot, and Gemini and OpenAI are selling us tokens by the truckload. Keep it coming!Now, on to a quick Q&A that will save you from reading through all the questions….Q: What is a credit and how are they used?A:For paid projects:~1 credit ≈ 1 delivered word+ a9,000-credit flat feeper project.Human Model:+20%.Advanced models:4× credits. Over-delivery is free; under-delivery credits are refunded.Q: What costs apply to sources and Human Models?A:Source upload:~1 credit/word (one-time; reuse is free).Human Model training:1 credit/10 wordsof samples (one-time); using it in a project adds+20%.Q: What does the BYOK discount mean?A:On book projects only, you pay20% (Tier 3)or10% (Tier 4)of the usual credits; AI calls billyourOpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic accounts. No discount on sources or Human Model training.Q: Which models are used? Can I choose?A:With BYOK you can pick provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) and level per task (brainstorming, writing, editing).Q: I’m seeing BYOK errors. Why?A:Usually your API key hit rate limits, was deactivated, or lacks quota. Youbooks retries for up to1 week, then cancels if not fixed. These are provider-side errors.Q: Best language for quality?A:LLMs have a slight edge inEnglish, but you shouldgenerate directlyin your target language. Translations are worse andKDP disallows AI translations.Q: Does Youbooks repurpose my transcripts/draft into a book?A:Not yet.Sources are usedas knowledge, not rearranged verbatim. It won’t finish/reshape a WIP, interleave personal stories, or turn classes into a book one-to-one.Q: Short books and fiction?A:Recommended above20K words; sweet spot70–100K. No fiction or short stories.Q: What genres work best?A:General non-fiction without heavy tables/images/XML. Sensitive topics may be blocked by provider safety filters (you’ll be refunded if a project can’t complete).Q: Can I write a series?A:Yes—pre-plan similar TOCs, useTOC Approval, and aHuman Modelfor consistent voice.Q: Can I control how much comes from my sources vs web?A:No. With web research enabled, anything relevant may be used; sources inform the text but aren’t forced in.Q: How does TOC Approval (beta) work?A:The run starts, thenpauses ~5 minutes in. You’ll see “TOC approval requested” on the book; edit/submit the TOC. The workflow resumes (typically within about an hour).Q: Citations and references?A:No in-text (e.g., Harvard) citations. A per-section URL export is planned; not for academic papers.Q: Images and covers?A:Not generated. Add them externally.Q: Can Youbooks edit/extend my book later?A:No in-app editor/extension. Export and edit in your tool of choice.Q: I have an old LTD—can I stack AppSumo?A:Create anew account with a different email, then emailmaster@youbooks.comtomergebenefits into your original account.Q: Commercial (paid) books—who owns the rights?A:You do. “Premium Quality” (paid) books are private; Youbooks claims no rights.Quick Practical TipsIf exact word count matters, expect variance and plan to trim.You can use onesource per project today (combine files if needed); raising to multiple is planned.Always train aHuman Modelin the same language as your target book.Hit issues?

It's laid out nicely and appeared to be on the right path.  The founder seems responsive, makes updates/handles requests quickly, and is responsive here answering questions.The features are laid out nice and beneficial.  I have encountered my fair share of bugs daily and do wish the site was faster/more responsive.  It's slow to reach to clicks sometimes, for things to pop up or open, and overall speed could be improved.With that said, while I like the tool, as is the tool is overpriced in a competitive CRM marketplace, when it was just launched and has a small team.  When they finally rolled out API/Webhooks, I was shocked to see only Tier 4 included it.Now we see that new updates / items on the roadmap that users were excited about, only to see now that their in higher Tiers, requiring us to upgrade.  This also isn't a great sign for the future updates as they'll likely not be included, require an up charge fee monthly outside of the LTD.I really hope this Founder can rethink his pricing and offer structure to the early adaptors as it's a great product being built by feedback of the users.  Sadly, I've purchased enough deals to see these red flags and proceed with caution.For those invested, I'm hoping this turns out great and I'm wrong on this one.Read lessFounder TeamHadi.azeezOct 31, 2025Hi, we’re really grateful for everyone who shares feedback and supports us early.You can join our Discord or text us directly, you’ll see how fast we respond and fix things for everyone. The only reason API & Webhooks are in Tier 4 is to create a proper plan differentiation. In fact, this was something many users requested, to make higher tiers more valuable.That said, I’ve already asked the team to include API & Webhooks in Tier 3 as well. I even gave access to a user who reached out personally, because we genuinely care.If this is the only reason you’re stepping away, please come back, I’ll make sure you get access, brother :)Everyone here is valuable to us, and we’ll continue improving daily.Helpful?9ShareShare HefflSee detailsabrinemolVerified purchaserDeals bought: 1Member since: Oct 2025Oct 31, 2025Genuinely impressedI’m genuinely impressed with Heffl, this tool perfectly matches my CRM and project management needs.

I mainly used it as a CRM.For context: I really does not like to work with tools like Asana, where i have the feeling of quickly drowning in tasks.Features which are are plus:- LinkedIn Integration: It is a great feature if your leads are coming in by LinkedIn to stay organized. Also you can save templates for often used answers. 6$ a month is more than fair for that.- the features of customized fields and using lists is definitely a plus. Overall the tool seems very flexibel.- the enrichment of leads, clients etc. are pretty amazing. If I uploaded contacts and clients it connects automatically the dots.- It is nice that it has an unlimited automation function-Setting up projects and connecting tasks is very easy and has a good look.-The support really cares about customer requests in general.Quirks and Cons:- The handlings seems sometimes unhandy. E.g. if you want to add a phone-number in a deal or lead, you have to click ""edit"" first to open the entity or jump to the right entity.- It is not possibly to see the value of your pipeline (Dealsize x probability of closing). You can add the probability for each stage but it has not function. This is a Key-KPI for me and def. a show stopper for further use.- The support reacts quickly but does not always deliver in time as promised. It can take a while or some reminder.- The automation-options are quite limited. It is basically just writing mails or notification if a unspecific trigger happend, eg. ""update of a deal"". Specific trigger as ""field xy are updated"" are not predefined. The integration of webhooks and APIs just launched sounds promising, but also requires another automation software in the backround. And it does not seem possible to update fields automatically at all.- There is no real process for the LinkedIn/WA-Subscriptions. It takes some efforts in communication but the founder is really engaged in solving everything for satisfaction.So overall it seems like solid and promising software and ppl who are used to Asana will definitely love it, but not my cup of tea.Read lessFounder TeamHadi.azeezEdited Oct 31, 2025Hey, thanks for the detailed review :)Really happy that you noticed our effort and mentioned how engaged we are with users, means a lot.All the points you mentioned are valid, and we’ve already started improving the automation module and pipeline view.

I wasn’t asking how many phone numbers I get with Dialora. I meant how many I can add and use with their own AI assistants, whether ported from Twilio or purchased thru Dialora, and if there’s a cost for having extra numbers on the account?2. What is one credit good for?3. Will you assist with porting a number from Phone.com?4. How is support handled and how quick?Thx!Founder TeamAvi_DialoraNov 2, 2025A: Great follow-up questions! thanks for taking the time to dig deeper! Let’s go point by point:1️⃣ Multiple Numbers & AI AgentsYou can add multiple phone numbers to your Dialora account — whether they’re purchased directly through us or brought in via Twilio/Telnyx (BYOK). Each number can have its own AI assistant and call workflow. You can bring in as many numbers as you like. If you buy from us, we charge $11/month/number. But you can port or BYOK from Twilio.2️⃣ What One Credit CoversCredits are our unified system for call usage. 10 credits = 1 minute of AI call time — and that already includes the full stack:•	Carrier cost (Telnyx/Twilio)•	AI voice processing (ElevenLabs)•	Speech-to-text, LLM processing, and call transcriptionSo you don’t need to pay separate fees for each service — it’s all-inclusive.Porting a NumberYes, we can assist with number porting from Phone.com or other providers that support standard carrier transfer (LoA + account PIN). Please book a short setup call here: https://cal.com/dialora/30min￼ and our team will walk you through the exact steps.Support Response TimesWe handle support through live chat, email, and video calls. During normal hours, response times are typically under 24 hours, and for AppSumo users, we prioritize onboarding or technical setup issues first.If you’d like us to walk you through setup or number porting directly, please grab a slot here: https://cal.com/dialora/30min, we’ll get you live quickly.Comment(1)ShareShare DialoraHelpful?0Log in to join the conversationLog inegor_ukPLUSThank you, Avi, this answers all my questions!

You’ll see several updates going live this week.Comment(1)ShareShare DialoraHelpful?0Log in to join the conversationLog inNC23PLUSVerified purchasercan I get a refund or atleast some free credits that were used up for testing phone calls? I can't test inbound or outbound calls without being charged? Even less that a minute, I get charged 20 credits... the credit system is bad. you get charged too much even for testing a phone call. Also please give the option to add xsl documents to contact list.Guy+GoatGuy+GoatNov 1, 2025See detailQ:How much does this actually cost?For the lowest tier the details show a very very misleading 50 monthly credits for phone calls which is actually 5 minutes. The one-time 150 minutes built into the plan won't last long. You need to pay Twilio for a phone number in order to use this as an answering service, but the good news is 5 minutes per month is going to cost nearly nothing.So, what else am I missing? Is there any way to turn off overage use or will it just start charging you in the background?Founder TeamAvi_DialoraNov 2, 2025A: Totally fair question and thank you for asking it so directly.Here’s how it really works, without any fluff:Included Credits (Lifetime + Monthly)Each AppSumo plan includes a one-time pool of credits (e.g. 1,500 on Tier 1) plus recurring monthly credits (e.g. 50/month). These monthly credits renew automatically every month, forever so you always have usage capacity without paying extra unless you go over.Phone NumbersEach AppSumo plan also includes one free phone number, you don’t need to pay Twilio directly. If you prefer to bring your own provider (BYOK with Twilio/Telnyx), that’s optional.Overage ControlYou will never be automatically charged. Dialora does not auto-bill AppSumo users. If you ever exceed your credits, calls simply stop until you choose to top up manually — no hidden or background charges.Add-On CreditsIf you want more usage, you can buy optional add-ons: 1,000 credits for $20 (which covers ~100 minutes of call time, including AI, telephony, transcription, and storage).We keep pricing transparent, there are no surprise fees or silent overages.Comment(1)ShareShare DialoraHelpful?0Log in to join the conversationLog inGuy+GoatTo be clear the first plan includes only 5 minutes per month which is maybe two or three calls max.View more questions'Customers are all about Dialora, praising its powerful AI voice agent that efficiently turns missed calls into closed deals, its simple setup, and fast onboarding process. The cherry on top is the responsive team support. There are a few hiccups like challenges with KYC verification and limited local operability in certain regions, just small bumps on the road. Weighing the raves against the occasional grumbles, Dialora is hitting the mark and is a solid buy for those in need of an AI voice agent.

After submitting all KYC documents, completing a video call, and correctly adding all NS and CAA records in Cloudflare, there’s been no follow-up or final confirmation for several days.Also, in Mexico it cannot connect with Twilio — only with Telnyx — which limits its local operability.The platform shows great potential, it’s clearly well-engineered and business-oriented, but the lack of consistent support and communication makes it non-functional at this stage.I truly hope the Dialora team resolves the verification and caching issues soon. I’ll update this review in one month depending on progress.Read lessFounder TeamAvi_DialoraNov 2, 2025Thank you so much for the thoughtful and fair review — we really appreciate the recognition of Dialora’s underlying architecture and integrations. You’re absolutely right: the platform is built for scale and reliability but we know our KYC and verification flow hasn’t been as smooth as it should be lately.To clarify, we’ve been migrating our entire telephony backend from Twilio to Telnyx, which temporarily affected a few users, especially in regions like Mexico where Twilio connectivity is limited. That migration is now in its final phase, and verification queues are being cleared in the next 48 hours.We truly value your patience and the time you’ve invested in setting up the domain and DNS configurations, you did everything right on your end. We’ll personally ensure your KYC and setup are finalized this week.Appreciate your constructive feedback, it helps us keep improving. Expect smoother communication and much faster onboarding moving forward.Helpful?1ShareShare DialoraSee detailBigmanPLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 299Member since: May 2015Nov 1, 2025Excellent Product - One of the Best Deals AppSumo has offeredI've been testing and using Dialora for several weeks and it's definitely one of the platinum level tools that I've purchased on AppSumo over the last nearly 10 years. There's a learning curve but it's easier then expected to master.Based on my experience as a verified purchaser, Dialora is an game changer for our agency. The product itself has massive potential and is one of the best AI Voice Agent platforms I've used. It's exceptionally well-designed and powerful.I was so impressed after trying the demo that I immediately purchased the 5 Tier plan. The setup was incredibly simple—I just provided a Word document with the information I wanted it to learn, and the agent instructions and the AI was trained and ready to go. When I called in to test it, the performance was amazing. It successfully handled everything I was hoping for and more, effectively weeding out unnecessary callbacks while providing vital information to prospective customers.Beyond the product's capabilities, the Dialora team has been highly responsive and helpful, which has been crucial for adoption and problem-solving. The integrations are decent via custom integrations. While there's always room for improvement (like enhanced email and SMS messaging features), it's clear the team is actively working on updates.Dialora has been exactly what I needed to take our agency to the next level, saving me significant time during my business day. I highly recommend it to any agency or business owner looking to turn missed calls into booked appointments or leverage an AI voice agency platform for their clients.Read lessFounder TeamAvi_DialoraNov 2, 2025Wow — thank you so much for this incredible review!We can’t tell you how much it means to see a long-time AppSumo user recognize the vision and potential behind Dialora. You really captured what we’re building — not just another AI tool, but a true voice automation platform that agencies and business owners can rely on every day.We’re thrilled that the setup and training process worked smoothly for you and that you’re already seeing results in your agency. We’re continuously improving the platform — especially around multi-channel messaging (email + SMS), and the next few updates will make it even more seamless for your clients.Your words remind the entire team why we do this. Thank you for being an early supporter and for helping shape the future of AI voice technology with us.Helpful?1ShareShare DialoraSee detailDSMagicPLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 90Member since: Jun 2017Oct 31, 2025So far this looks like smoke and mirrorsI purchased the Tier 3 Plan and after 2 weeks of trying I am pretty close to giving up hope that this will ever be a usable product. I don't think there has ever been a product on AppSumo that I was so hopeful for, and so willing to work through the issues to get something working as this one, but in the end I do not see anything working and I'm losing hope.All it does is answer calls but it can't do anything with the calls except chit chat. I had to use my own Twilio numbers to test because the free Twillio number doesn't work. I can't get it to forward the call or do anything beyond wasting the callers time. The templates requires a separate subscription to something called GoHighLevel. Why call it templates? Just call it a GoHighLevel Connector. I'm completely baffled by the reason for having a Workflow tab that literally does nothing. You can type text to be read out to a caller, that's all. But my biggest complaint by far, is that I've had the product for nearly 2 weeks and I still have not been able to get a single word of support. They have some sort of service where you can book a 30 minute session but all the sessions are after midnight. Why can't I just get a response to my questions? Why do I have to book a google meeting at 3 AM to get any support? Reading through most of the responses to most of the questions here does not give me much hope either. I'm getting more frustrated every day.UPDATE: Nope still no time slots available between 4 AM and 11 PM. I just tested it again and nothing has changed. I'm very concerned about the sources of all your positive reviews. Ite's very suspicious because it's not possible that anyone is having a good experience of this product because it doesn't do anything useful. Who would possibly give this a positive review when it hangs up on every caller? That's very suspicious.Read lessFounder TeamAvi_DialoraNov 2, 2025Hey DSMagic,First, I completely understand your frustration. You’re right to expect more, and we take your experience seriously.To clarify a few key points:1️⃣ Call Forwarding & WorkflowsYou’re correct that forwarding and workflow logic were limited at launch but those functions are now being rebuilt as part of our new advanced workflow engine (rolling out in phases starting this week). It enables mid-call routing, condition logic, and API actions not just message playback.2️⃣ Twilio Number IssueThe temporary number glitch came from our migration to Telnyx, which is nearly complete. This will give all users—including you—direct number provisioning inside Dialora (no need for separate Twilio setup).3️⃣ Templates & GoHighLevelThe “GHL templates” are optional for those using GoHighLevel, not required for operation. You can fully build and use AI agents without a GHL account.4️⃣ Support & Scheduling TimesWe’ve recently added more global support hours (US, EU, and APAC coverage). You don’t have to book a late-night call anymore — just choose a convenient time here:👉 https://cal.com/dialora/30min￼If you’d prefer, we can also handle this via email and get you personally set up within 24 hours.DSMagic, we know you’ve been patient — and we truly appreciate it. We’re not smoke and mirrors; we’re just an early-stage product growing fast, and your feedback helps us prioritize the right fixes. I’d love to get you up and running personally — can we book a call today?Helpful?6ShareShare DialoraSee detail109166895095091000560PLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 12Member since: Jan 2021Oct 26, 2025Cannot Resubmit KYC. Button broken - Will be requesting refund in 7 days if not fixed.** UPDATE **Nothings changed. You haven't fixed anything. Clicking on the resubmit button doesn't do anything. If I try to order a new number, it says I can't because I need to resubmit KYC paperwork. But the button doesn't work. What am I meant to do? Fix your website.This is a joke.---Bought with the intention for Ai to answer the phone if I'm busy or out of hours. It's pretty good, but you get one pool of credits and it's essentially pay as you go. Unless you get free credits per month which would be acceptable, but I can't find mention of that anyway.I got my free number and my KYC was rejected. No problem, but trying to resubmit with acceptable documents is impossible.You go to the KYC section, attach the new document and click the submit button. Only thing is the button doesn't do anything so you basically get locked out of using the service with no way to complete KYC.I did get a response asking me to attach my document to email and they'd manually do it, but that was done a while ago and KYC still hasn't been completed.So seems like a good product, but I can't use it and the website/platform clearly doesn't work properly. Plus testing the ai costs credits. I've used half just getting it set up. I hope we get free credits each month otherwise it's a pointless 'lifetime' promotion.So yeah, will wait a week and then ask for a full refund if still no kyc.Read lessFounder TeamAvi_DialoraOct 27, 2025Hi there, I completely understand your frustration — and I’m really sorry for the inconvenience you’ve experienced.We’ve already fixed the KYC resubmission glitch, but in your specific case, your KYC isn’t showing as approved because a phone number was not selected during the verification process. Once that’s chosen, your approval can go through smoothly.Over the past week, we’ve also been experiencing temporary KYC verification delays due to our migration to Telnyx (our new telecom provider). We’re actively working with their team, and this will be fully resolved within the week.In the meantime, please book a priority KYC session here so we can help finalize your setup and get your number activated right away:👉 https://cal.com/dialora/30minWe truly appreciate your patience and understanding — your account and credits are completely safe, and we’ll make sure you’re up and running shortly.Helpful?3ShareShare DialoraSee detailarbhaveshPLUSVerified purchaserDeals bought: 19Member since: Feb 2024Oct 23, 2025i've finally stopped loosing revenue from manual callsSo, I am a solo nocode founder here. onboarding was great setup everything in 15min, picked a template , write a short consent line & set a rule to transfer to me when the caller said ""pricing""it books directly to my calender and drops clear transcripts in my crm via zapierthis is what i liked• Setup is simple.
